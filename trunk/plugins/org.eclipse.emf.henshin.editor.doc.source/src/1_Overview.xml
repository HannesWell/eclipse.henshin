	<para>This part of the documentation covers the tree-based Editor for
		Henshin Transformation Models.</para>

	<para>The editor is a customization of the default editor generated by
		EMF. It follows the free-editing paradigm that is commonly expected
		from EMF editors. To alleviate creating, editing and reading
		transformation models, it brings a variety of display customizations,
		like context-sensitive icons, selection-based coloring of semantically
		associated elements and dynamic filtering. The default editing actions
		are complemented by a suite of advanced editing actions leveraging the
		EMF Command Framework. To facilitate the testing of transformations
		during the development, a wizard allows to invoke transformations to
		preview their effect using the EMF Compare services and visualization.
		Syntactic analysis may be performed by invoking the EMF Model
		Validation on selected elements.
